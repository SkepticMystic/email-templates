# Emails

Emails allows you to import `.eml` files into Obsidian as markdown using templates.

You first need to download the email as a `.eml` file. This can normally be done by opening the email in your email client and clicking the **Download** button.

Once you have the file, run the `Import Email` command, and select the file.
Emails will import the `.eml` file and apply your template (or the default template) to it. The output will be inserted under your cursor.
